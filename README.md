# Breakout-Game
### Clone of the Classic game Breakout, based off MDN Game Development Tutorial found at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript.
### Music: "Circular Strings Theme" from http://www.freesfx.co.uk/, renamed for pathing convienience original filename "15220_1460389656.mp3" Thanks for the tunes!
### "Press Start 2P" font by CodeMan38 https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P, Thanks!

### Try to break the bricks! Mouse or ArrowKey controls. Players will have 3 attempts to clear the screen before a Game Over. Game has music, but you have to start it yourself and might find it somewhat grating. Feel free to mute it or lower it's volume to your liking (be quick about it though!).
